                <p>
                    We buy and sell rare books and support our customers with expert advice and first class service. We focus primarily on the James Bond series, Science Fiction, Rare Children¿s books, and select other rare books. Because of our specialization, we have developed a deep expertise in these categories and are able to offer a good selection of authors and titles across the quality and price spectrum. To be able to offer rare books of extraordinary quality, we have cultivated relationships with several premier conservators, who restore and conserve books on behalf of museums and private collectors. Our approach has lead to satisfied customers who have become repeat buyers, many of whom have built attractive collections as alternative investments. Our commitment to customers is backed by our return policy, which is simple: if you are not happy with your purchase, you may return the book for a full refund. <br>
