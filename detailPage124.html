                    Synopsis: <br>
                    The recipes and techniques demonstrated on Julia Child's television program are presented in chronological order <br>
                    
                    From the Publisher: <br>
                    Over a ten years ago I was working at a posh restaurant in New York, The China Grill as a waitress. I was told that I would have a table of fifteen in my section that night, and that they were serious foodies. Little did I expect Julia Child to be at the center of the table! I was terrified, having revered her for so many years expected her to be some sort of Olympian goddess. To my delight, she was incredibly down to earth, and extraordinarily appreciative of my service. After every plate of food and every new bottle of wine, she'd tell me how lovely everything was. At the end of the night, she told me I was lovely as well. It was one of the greatest tables of my lengthy career. Now, many years later, I'm the editor for this book. I doubt if she remembers the younger me, but I'll never forget her generosity, which she still has in abundance.
