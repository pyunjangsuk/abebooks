                <h3>About this Item</h3>
                <p>Octavo, cloth. First U.S. edition. A translation of DIE UNENDLICHE GESCHICHTE (1979). "In an interesting commentary on the act of reading fantasy and on the nature of story itself, a boy named Bastian becomes so involved in reading of the amazing adventures of Atreyu in a book, also called THE NEVERENDING STORY, that he becomes part of the story himself, managing to save the fantasy land of the story in the process. The book's use of mythic materials and fantasy tropes is far more sophisticated than one might expect from a children's book, and the common theme of experience and maturity is also treated well. As might be expected from a novel celebrating the joys of reading, the book is considerably better than the 1984 movie version." - Barron (ed), Fantasy and Horror (1999) 7-115. A fine copy in fine dust jacket (no printed price on front flap; but not price-clipped) with just a touch of wear at spine ends. A very nice copy. (#159046). Seller Inventory # 159046</p>
