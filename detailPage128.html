                    Synopsis: <br>
                    The authors of the national bestseller The Silver Palate Cookbook now bring their acclaimed gourmet style to graceful entertaining at home. In The Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook, Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins make the entire year a celebration of good food, good friends, and good times, as they offer menus, suggestions, and strategies. More than 450 new recipes have been developed especially for this collection.All add to the joyfulness of the rapidly growing Silver Palate legend: there are glorious soups, savory entrees, vegetables, salads, cheese, souffles, and showstopping, just-right desserts. <br>

                    As warmly inviting as the most rousing party, the pages of The Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook abound with winsome line illustrations, pertinent quotations, unusual ideas―and with dishes including Cajun Chicken Morsels, Duck and Dandelion Green Salad, Pesto Fondue, Tex-Mex Stuffed Peppers, and more. The excitement begins in spring and continues right through to winter, with a lavish Christmas Goose accompanied by Scalloped Oysters and Baked Kumquats. The good times are here, with the compliments of The Silver Palate. <br>
                    
                    Book Description: <br>
                    From the authors of The Silver Palate Cookbook (2.2 million copies in print), here is The Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook. This time the authors focus on entertaining company and making any occasion special with the right ingredients and imagination. <br>
                    
                    With the same spirit and culinary daring that catapulted the first Silver Palate Cookbook into over 700,000 homes, the Good Times Cookbook brings to each season a sense of the memorable. Dinner a deux becomes a fireside clambake. Spring is heralded with early chEvres, curry bread, glasses of chablis. Summer sizzles with swordfish barbecue, while autumn refreshes with wild mushroom forays and the crunch of favorite nuts. And to round out the year, thereís the splendid formality of Broiled Oysters with Arugula PurEe and an elegant Dacquoise. <br>
                    
                    Throughout, Sheila Lukinsís charming illustrations highlight the more than 450 recipes, menus, and unexpected pairings. Sidebars and marginalia resolve the dilemmas of modern entertainingówhether Beaujolais is lusty enough for lamb, which cheeses start a meal and which end it with a flourish, how to make the presentation of food as lush as the taste.
