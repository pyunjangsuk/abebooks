                    Synopsis: <br>
                    Now featuring new instructions, new illustrations, and new information, The Principles of Knitting—beloved by knitters everywhere and one of the most requested out-of-print books for years—finally gets the revision that fans have been clamoring for! <br>
                    
                    A treasured guide beloved by knitters everywhere, the classic book The Principles of Knitting is finally available again in a fully revised and updated edition. This is the definitive book on knitting techniques, with valuable information for everyone from beginners to experienced knitters. June Hiatt presents not only a thorough, thoughtful approach to the craft, but also a passion for carrying on the art of knitting to future generations. She has repeatedly tested the various techniques and presents them with clear, easy-to-follow instructions—as well as an explanation of what each one can contribute to your knitting. Informed by decades of experience and thousands of hours of practice, this comprehensive resource offers a variety of ways to approach every skill and technique and offers solutions that can help solve the most challenging aspects of any knitting project. <br>
                    
                    From Library Journal: <br>
                    This is a comprehensive handbook for the knitter who wants to know the "whys" as well as the "hows" of hand-knitted fabric construction. Included are chapters on stitch formation, fabric construction, pattern design, project planning, and decorative work (e.g., multi-color knitting, inlay, and needlework embellishment). Superior organization, layout, indexing, and the numerous illustrations add to the value of this work as a basic knitting reference, but the beginning knitter may be intimidated by the sheer bulk of material presented--including, for example, 33 different methods for casting on stitches. A less intimidating introduction to the craft is Maggie Righetti's Knitting in Plain English ( LJ 3/15/86). Highly recommended for libraries collecting in this area. <br>
