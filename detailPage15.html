                <p>L4 - A first edition (complete numberline) hardcover book SIGNED and dated by Laura Esquivel on the title page in as new condition in as new dust jacket. Translated by Ernesto Mestre-Reed. Illustrations by Jordi Castells. Laura Esquivel, the princess of Latin American literature, is back. Her new novel, Malinche, is an extraordinary retelling of the passionate and tragic love affair between the conquistador Hernan Cortes and his interpreter, Malinallini. 8.5"x5.75", 208 pages. Satisfaction Guaranteed. When Malinalli, a member of a tribe conquered by the Aztec warriors, first meets Cortes, she - like many - believes that he is the reincarnated forefather god of her tribe. Naturally, she assumes that her task is to help Cortes destroy the Aztec empire and free her people. The two fall passionately in love, but Malinalli gradually comes to realize that Cortes thirst for conquest is all too human. He is willing to destroy anyone, even his own men, even their own love. Throughout Mexican history, Mailinalli has been reviled for her betrayal of the Indian people. However, recent historical research has shown that her role was much more complex; she was the mediator between two cultures, Hispanic and Native American, and two languages, Spanish and Nahuati. Bursting with lyricism and vivid imagery, Malinche finally unveils the truth behind this legendary love affair. Size: 8vo - over 7¾" - 9¾" tall. Seller Inventory # EC6835BB</p>
