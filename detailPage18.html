                <p>
                    Synopsis: <br>
                    A savvy businesswoman and an assassin struggle to outwit the FBI -- and each other -- in this #1 NYT bestselling story of sizzling romance and shocking deception from "a masterful storyteller" (USA Today). <br>
                    When Jordie Bennet and Shaw Kinnard lock eyes across a disreputable backwater bar, something sparks. Shaw is a man who gives off a dangerous vibe that makes other men stand back and women take notice. No one feels this more strongly than Jordie, a woman who doesn't belong in a seedy dive on the banks of a bayou. But here she is . . . and Shaw Kinnard is here to kill her. <br>
                    As Shaw takes aim, Jordie is certain her time has come. Instead, Shaw has other plans. He abducts Jordie, hoping to get his hands on the $30 million her brother has stolen. But he isn't the only one: Jordie's brother made a deal with the FBI, but his ruthless boss will stop at nothing to find the money first. Now on the run from the feds and a notorious criminal, Jordie and Shaw must rely on their wits to stay alive. <br>
                    Miles away from civilization and surrounded by swampland, Jordie and Shaw play each other against their common enemies. Jordie's only chance of survival is to outwit Shaw, but he suspects her from the start. Was she in on her brother's scam, or is she an innocent pawn in this deadly vendetta? And just how valuable is her life to Shaw, her remorseless and manipulative captor? Burning for answers -- and for each other -- this unlikely pair ultimately make a desperate move that could be their last. <br>
                    With nonstop plot twists and the sizzling sexual tension that has made Sandra Brown one of the world's most beloved authors, Sting will keep you on the edge of your seat until its final pages. <br>

                <h3>Store Description</h3>
                <p>
                    We started selling books at the Toronto Book Fair in the Fall of 1996. In 2004 we opened up a Brick and Mortar store on the corner of Lakeshore and Bronte. We unfortunately only lasted for 2 years. Then we closed the B&M and moved everything back home. We continue to do book shows such as the Bouchercon, Bloody Words, The Toronto Book Fair, The Ottawa Antiquarian Show and Thrillerfest. In order to sell and acquire signatures. Thank you. <br>
