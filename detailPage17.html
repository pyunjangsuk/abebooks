                <h3>About this Item</h3>
                <p>First American Edition (SD). This book is an quite nice condition. You can see the covers in the photos. They are clean. The lettering on the front and on the spine is nicely bright. There's a little nick at the top edge of the spine, not a tear. There's also a little spot of fraying on the front side of the spine just off the top edge. There is one thin crinkle just off the bottom edge of the spine. The cover edges are in very good shape. The yellow part of the top edges is a little darkened. There is no rubbing on any of the cover edges. The four corners each have very tiny spots of rubbing. The top page edge is pinkish red or reddish pink. The middle part of it has faded. All three page edges are quite clean. The book is square and the spine is straight. The binding is very solid from cover to cover, exactly as you would want it, with nicely tight pages throughout and nicely tight covers as well. The pages are exceptionally clean. Scrolling through, I'm not finding any soiling. There is toning, but it is uniform. The white inside covers and end papers are also very clean and also have some light toning. There is no foxing anywhere in the book. The pages are also in very good condition. I'm not finding any creasing at all, no turned- down corners, no placeholder creases, nothing. Nor are there any markings or attachments of any kind. And no one has written their name or anything else anywhere in the book. The jacket has held up quite nicely. I have had it in a fitted protective cover for as long as I have owned the book. It does have slivers of loss in a few places, off the top and bottom edges of the spine, off the bottom edge of the front just adjacent to the spine, off the top edge of the rear, and at a few of the corners. There's also a scuff on the spine, and some vertical scuffing at the juncture between the front and spine. The jacket looks quite clean. There is a little sliver of loss at the top edge of the front flap, and a teeny tiny loss at the front flap's bottom corner. Nevertheless, the flaps presents quite nicely and they are very clean. As I am limited on the number of photos, you can contact me if you are wanting to see a photo of the flaps or anything else. The jacket is NOT price-clipped, not clipped at all. You will probably be able to read the blurb on the front cover of the jacket in the photos that I haven't yet scanned. It's a short one from the New York Times: 'A literary force, transcending nationality and language, comparable certainly to Flaubert, to Hardy, or to James.' From the dust jacket's front flap: 'Considered by many Machado's greatest work, Dom Casmurro is a novel of love and suspected betrayal. It traces the flowering and destruction of a childhood romance. In Portuguese, casmurro means a morose, tight-lipped man, withdrawn within himself. Benito Santiago, hero and narrator of this novel, is such a person, ironically called Dom Casmurro by his friends. The darkness and shadows of the present dissipate as Benito sketches his memories of youth. The dilemma of young love is made poignant through the efforts of Benito and his girlfriend to resist his mother's intention to make him a priest. The quarrels, the desire for each other, so clumsy and youthful, the complex evasion of adult watchfulness, are described so adroitly that the reader feels his own life being told. But Benito's tragedy is already implicit in these apparently idyllic moments. He is a man born to be deceived or to deceive himself. The startlingly original dénouement of this novel permits either interpretation. Those who read Dom Casmurro will not easily forget it.'. Seller Inventory # 005211</p>

                <h3>Store Description</h3>
                <p>
                    Many of the books I will be selling can accurately be described as ranging from somewhat rare to very rare. In some cases there won't be another copy for sale anywhere on the Internet. There doesn't seem much point, for you or me, in offering something that so many others are already offering. Subject matter will range very widely, creating the possibility for people with very different interests to find something that excites them. As regards pricing, my primary goal is to sell the book. Most often I would expect my book to be the least expensive option on the Internet taking into account an appropriate comparison(what is the condition, is the dust jacket present, is the book signed, is it a first printing, etc.). More important than selling the book I want to make sure that you know, as much as is possible, exactly what you are getting. To that end, you'll notice that my descriptions of condition tend to be lengthy, and that there will always be photographs to help you draw your own conclusions. Please feel free to contact me with any questions about a given book. As regards international shipping, the first class or standard rates I charge are based on a package weight between 2 and 3 pounds. If the book is on the thin side there is a possibility that I can securely pack it up under 2 pounds in weight. If so, the shipping price will drop by around $11.00 or $12.00 to $26.00-27.00. Canada, which is less expensive drops to $18.00. You can contact me before purchasing a book for an estimate on the shipping cost. If you buy the book and it weighs in below 2 pounds you'll get a Reduced Shipping message and amount with the invoice and you'll see the lowered final cost before you make your payment. <br>
