                    LESS THAN A DOZEN COPIES KNOWN. First edition, very rare, of this important work, of which "less than a dozen copies are known to exist, most imperfect" (The Roy G. Neville Historical Chemical Library, vol. 2, p. 153. "Sold only by the author at his home in Montpellier, the Pratique contains clear directions on practical operations and the preparation of chemicals. Matte la Faveur, distiller and demonstrator of chemistry at Montpellier, simultaneously gave a course at Paris until 1684, when he was succeeded by the famous chemist Nicolas Lemery. Undoubtedly, Lemery used this work when writing his celebrated Cours de Chymie (1675), and it is well known that he seldom acknowledged his sources. The Pratique forms a direct link between the Traité de la Chymie (1663) of Christophle Glaser and the Cours of Lemery" (Neville). Matte's Pratique de chymie gives a good indication of his teaching of the subject. He defined chemistry in its relation to medicine. It was 'the Art of separating the parts of a natural body, purifying them, and reuniting them for their use in Medicine. His elementary substances were phlegm, spirit, sulphur, salt, and 'terre morte', the most commonly accepted groups from this period. After a description of chemical operations and equipment he devoted the remainder of his book to chemical preparations, which he divided into the customary categories of mineral, vegetable, and animal" (Debus, p. 144). "Matte la Faveur adopts the traditional Aristotelian distinction between perfect and imperfect mixts, which he interprets in vague corpuscular terms. Imperfect mixts, he says, are those which can easily be decomposed by heat; perfect ones are those which resist the action of heat, because their parts have a closer union. The chemical principles, he asserts, are not the same in the three kingdoms of nature. Volatility, he states, is a relative quality. Though mercury is the most volatile among the principles, salts too are volatile, though in different degrees. The same principle can be more or less volatile, according to the natural kingdom from which it originates. The principles of minerals are the most fixed, those extracted from vegetables are the most volatile" (Clericuzio, p. 170). OCLC lists copies in US at Cornell, University of Delaware, Dickinson College, Harvard, University of Pennsylvania, Science History Institute (Othmer Library), Washington State, and University of Wisconsin-Madison. ABPC/RBH list three copies in the last 30 years. Assembled by the author himself, apparently in a somewhat haphazard manner, the make-up of different copies varies. Sebastien Matte la Faveur (1626-1714) was one of the most important chemists and pharmacists in 17th century France. The son of a master glassmaker from Haute-Ardèche, he was self-taught. His discovery of styptic water and other research led to a professorship at the University of Montpellier. His lavender distillate known as "the water of the queen of Hungary" (Aqua Reginae Hungariae), earned him the title of "pharmacies particulier du Roi Louis XIV" and another chair at the Sorbonne. In 1684 his position in Paris was taken over by Nicolas Lemery, who acknowledged that he used this work in the preparation of his Cours de Chymie (1675). He was knighted by Louis XIV who extended his surname Matte to 'Matte La Faveur'. Matte la Faveur "opened his Pratique de chymie of 1671 with a preface to the reader excusing himself for publishing another 'Cours de Chymie'. Beguin, Hartmann, Croll, Quercetan (Du Chesne) and Schröder - had they not already taught all these preparations? And didn't it seem that in his time in France Davisson, Lefebure (Le Fèvre) and Glazer (Glaser) had left nothing new to say? But his fellow physicians have pressed him to publish and he has succumbed at last. He claims to offer some new preparations and to discover short cuts and easier methods to perform the most difficult operations. But rather than merely note his innovations, he has decided to.
