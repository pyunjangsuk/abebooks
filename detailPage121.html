                    Synopsis: <br>
                    The Peach Tree Tea Room Cookbook is a collection of proven recipes which Cynthia developed at her famous central Texas restaurant. Cynthia's reputation for preparing dishes, beautifully presented, from fresh seasonal ingredients, is renown. Her recipes are straightforward, using easy-to-find ingredients, where even the novice will feel comfortable. The book contains fabulous recipes for soups, quiches, sandwiches, salads, entrees, breads, and scrumptious desserts, all developed and served at her restaurant. Her Chilled Avocado Soup, Cynthia's Chicken Salad, Jalapeno-Potato Salad, Ice Cream Pie, and Collins Chocolate Cake, are legendary. <br>

                    About the Author: <br>
                    Cynthia Collins Pedregon was born and raised in a small ranch in the Texas Hill Country town of Medina. The mother of three children, she and her husband, Hector, have owned and operated The Peach Tree Gift Gallery and Tea Room in historic Fredericksburg, Texas, since 1972. In addition to her passion for cooking, Cynthia currently conducts cooking classes at her restaurant and is in demand at other cooking schools. She has written two other cookbooks, The Peach Tree Family Cookbook (now in its 3rd printing), and her latest, With Love, from Cynthia (printed Dec. 1999). Her loyal following, and the strong reception she has received from all three cookbooks, reflects the intensely personal relationship she has developed with her readers. Because Cynthia is so prolific in developing recipes for the restaurant, a new collection is generally published about every four years. Cynthia's recipes have won acclaim from Gourmet Magazine, American Country Cooking Cookbook, Dallas Morning News, and San Antonio Express-News. She is available for personal interviews as well as in-store book signings. <br>
