                <p>About the book: Hardcover with jacket. Assumed first Edition. Book has been inscribed by author on title page. Facing page contains drawing by author. Book is in good condition; however, there is one MAJOR FLAW: previous owner has torn away lower portion of title page, therefore, I can only sell this as an "AS IS" copy. Sad. Additional photos available upon request. We're not satisfied unless you are. Seller Inventory # 001904</p>
