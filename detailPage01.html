                <h3>About this Item</h3>
                <p>Stated First Edition. Once listed, this will be the Only signed copy for sale on the Internet. 
                    It will also only be the only twice signed copy. On the first front end paper there is an 
                    inscription that reads 'To Margaret-- Best wishes from my 'heart' to yours-- Susan Klein.' 
                    And then a few pages forward, on the blank verso of the half-title page, both authors 
                    have flat-signed their names, different handwriting, so clearly each of their own signatures. 
                    You can see the covers in the photos. They are very clean. They have a very nice rich color. 
                    The gilt lettering on the spine is very bright. The edges and corners look terrific. The top 
                    page edge has some tan or amber spotting, not terrible but it does manage to just peek 
                    over the top edge of a number of pages, typically just a speck of color, nothing conspicuous, 
                    and far from the print or illustrations. Otherwise, the pages are exceptionally clean and 
                    nicely bright. They are semi-glossy. I'm not finding any instances of soiling. And I'm not 
                    finding any instances of creasing. There are no markings. No attachments. And the 
                    aforementioned signatures and inscription is the only writing to be found in the book. 
                    The white inside covers and end papers are also perfectly clean. There are many, many 
                    illustrations, the great majority in color. They all appear to be in perfect condition. You can 
                    see the dust jacket in the first few photos. It's in nice shape. There are no tears. There are 
                    a few thin creases. There isn't any conspicuous soiling, maybe a slight bit of toning at the 
                    front top and bottom margins. The rear cover looks perfect. The white flaps very clean 
                    and in very good shape. The jacket is NOT priced-clipped, not clipped at all. It will be fitted 
                    with a protective cover after the photos are scanned. From the dust jacket: 'For lovers of 
                    Americana, for lovers of hearts and things antique and endearing, and for lovers-- a 
                    celebration in 150 photographs, 120 in full color, of the heart motif in American folk art 
                    from 1660 to 1880. Here are hearts embellishing everything from a family tree to a 
                    face-powder box, from samplers to scrimshaw, from weather vanes to valentines, the 
                    heart motif in American country furnishings, folk crafts, textiles, sculpture, kitchen 
                    implements, and the countless variety of love tokens, from a nineteenth-century 
                    whalebone busk (made by a sailor and intended for a lady's corset) to a watercolor 
                    "puzzle purse" (when open, it reveals a man picking a heart from a tulip tree). Captions 
                    and commentary complete this beautiful album of folk hearts in seventeenth-, eighteenth-, 
                    and nineteenth- century America, celebrating the heart and all its messages of true 
                    feeling-- courage, friendliness, tender courtship, fidelity, and romantic devotion.'.</p>

                <h3>Store Description</h3>
                <p>
                    Many of the books I will be selling can accurately be described as ranging from somewhat 
                    rare to very rare. In some cases there won't be another copy for sale anywhere on the 
                    Internet. There doesn't seem much point, for you or me, in offering something that so 
                    many others are already offering. Subject matter will range very widely, creating the 
                    possibility for people with very different interests to find something that excites them. 
                    As regards pricing, my primary goal is to sell the book. Most often I would expect my 
                    book to be the least expensive option on the Internet taking into account an appropriate 
                    comparison(what is the condition, is the dust jacket present, is the book signed, is it a 
                    first printing, etc.). More important than selling the book I want to make sure that you 
                    know, as much as is possible, exactly what you are getting. To that end, you'll notice that 
                    my descriptions of condition tend to be lengthy, and that there will always be photographs 
                    to help you draw your own conclusions. Please feel free to contact me with any questions 
                    about a given book. As regards international shipping, the first class or standard rates I 
                    charge are based on a package weight between 2 and 3 pounds. If the book is on the thin 
                    side there is a possibility that I can securely pack it up under 2 pounds in weight. If so, 
                    the shipping price will drop by around $11.00 or $12.00 to $26.00-27.00. Canada, which 
                    is less expensive drops to $18.00. You can contact me before purchasing a book for an 
                    estimate on the shipping cost. If you buy the book and it weighs in below 2 pounds you'll 
                    get a Reduced Shipping message and amount with the invoice and you'll see the lowered 
                    final cost before you make your payment.<br>
