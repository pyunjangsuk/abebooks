                <h3>About this title</h3>
                <p>
                    The Peach Tree Family Cookbook is a collection of proven recipes which Cynthia developed at her famous central Texas restaurant. Cynthia's reputation for preparing dishes, beautifully presented, from fresh seasonal ingredients, is renown. Her recipes are straightforward, using easy-to-find ingredients, where even the novice will feel comfortable. The book contains fabulous recipes for soups, quiches, sandwiches, salads, entrees, breads, and scrumptious desserts, all developed and served at her restaurant. From her Shrimp Strudel in Filo Pastry, Chicken Posole Soup to the Garlic Jalapeno-Potato Bread and Blackberry Cobbler--you will find this book a culinary delight! This, her second cookbook, features recipes not included in the first book, with the exception of the Collins Chocolate Cake, considered the signature dessert at the restaurant. Because Cynthia is so prolific in developing recipes to be used in the business, a new collection of recipes is generally published every four years. <br>

                    About the Author: <br>
                    Cynthia Collins Pedregon was born and raised in a small ranch in the Texas Hill Country town of Medina. The mother of three children, she and her husband, Hector, have owned and operated The Peach Tree Gift Gallery and Tea Room in historic Fredericksburg, Texas, since 1972. In addition to her passion for cooking, Cynthia currently conducts cooking classes at her restaurant and is in demand at other cooking schools. She has written two other cookbooks, The Peach Tree Tea Room Cookbook (now in its 6th printing), and her latest, With Love, from Cynthia (printed Dec. 1999). Her loyal following, and the strong reception she has received from all three cookbooks, reflects the intensely personal relationship she has developed with her readers. Cynthia's recipes have own acclaim from Gourmet Magazine, American Country Cooking Cookbook, Dallas Morning News, and San Antonio Express-News. She is available for personal interviews as well as in-store book signings. <br>
