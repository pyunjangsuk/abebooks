        <h2>How to buy items</h2>
        <span>May 4, 2023</span>
        <p>To buy an item on our sites, you need to create an account. You can create an account before searching for items or during checkout. If you've already added items to your shopping basket, you will be prompted to create an account when you're ready to checkout.</p>
        <div>
            <h3>How to buy an item</h3>
            <p>Search and find the item you want to purchase and click Add to Basket.</p>
            <p>Add all the items you want to purchase to the Basket.</p>
            <p>When you're ready to place an order, Click Basket.</p>
            <p>To buy multiple copies of the same book, update the Quantity field. To find out if the seller is offering multiple copies of an item, check the Quantity field on the listing page.</p>
            <p>To delete an item, click Remove. To keep an item in your basket for purchase at a later date, click Save for Later.</p>
            <p>If you have a coupon code, enter it into the Coupon field and select Apply coupon code.</p>
            <p>Proceed to Checkout to complete the order.</p>
            <p>Confirm that your shipping address, shipping amount and order details are correct.</p>
            <p>Select your payment method. If you're paying by credit card, you will be asked to provide the 3-digit security code on the back of the card. If you select a digital wallet like Apple or Google Pay as your payment method, you can pay with a valid Visa, Mastercard, American Express that can be used for online purchases. If you're paying the seller directly, they will contact you to arrange payment.</p>
            <p>Select Place order. A Thank You page will confirm that your order has been submitted and we'll send you an email confirmation within a few minutes. You will receive a second email when the seller processes your order. If your order includes multiple sellers, you will receive a separate confirmation email from each seller. </p>
            <p>The total amount displayed in the checkout includes the item price and shipping charges only. Any applicable customs duties or regulatory fees are the responsibility of the buyer. If local sales taxes are applicable, the seller will contact you directly.</p>
            <p>After you place an order, sellers have up to four days to process and ship your order. The Estimated Delivery Date can change after the seller ships the order.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Buying Multiple Items / Buying from Multiple Sellers</h3>
            <p>When you shop with us, you can add items from multiple sellers to your Basket</p>
            <p>If you order items from different sellers, individual shipping costs will apply to each seller's portion of the order. Sellers sometimes offer lower shipping rates when multiple copies of the same item are ordered.</p>
            <p>You can easily order items from one seller at a time by checking out with Pay Only This Seller</p>
            <p>To use Pay Only This Seller:</p>
            <p>From your Basklet select Pay Only This Seller</p>
            <p>Choose your payment method</p>
            <p>Review your order for the Pay Only This Seller item(s)</p>
            <p>Place your order and review the Thank you page</p>
            <p>Digital wallets don’t support payments to multiple sellers in a single order. If you select a digital wallet as your payment method, include items only from one seller in a single order.</p>
