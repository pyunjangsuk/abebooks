                    Synopsis: <br>
                    The Halloween Children are watching—they’re always watching in this chilling novel of suburban horror from Bram Stoker Award winner Norman Prentiss and Brian James Freeman of Cemetery Dance Publications. The accommodations at Stillbrook Apartments aren’t exactly glamorous, but they’re quiet, affordable, and well maintained. The handyman is usually available to help with a leak or a broken bulb, his wife and two adorable kids often tagging along. When occasion dictates, the neighbors gather to wish each other well and spread the requisite holiday cheer. Everything’s very nice. Very normal. But as Halloween approaches, strange occurrences are happening all around Stillbrook. The children tell disturbing stories, bizarre noises bleed through the walls, and one abandoned unit is found to be inhabited by something sinister—something that’s no longer alive. For the safety of the tenants, the Halloween party has been canceled. There will be no decorations or masks, no candied apples or witch’s brew. But without treats to divert the Halloween Children, they have no choice but to play some very nasty tricks. <br>

                    Review: <br>
                    The Halloween Children goes beyond the creepy kids and paranormal hauntings tropes to deliver a disturbing and thought-provoking look into family dynamics and our own changing imaginations. --Rue Morgue <br>
                    
                    This is an unsettling and complex work of fiction... The Halloween Children is a superb celebration of the season, and also offers up a timely reminder not to be a spoilsport or grouch at this time of the year, a reminder pitched in a refreshingly different and entertaining manner. --Black Static <br>
                    
                    A beautifully-written, scary novel that is as much about the dark side of marriage as it is a savagely disturbing Halloween yarn. --Horror Drive-In <br>
